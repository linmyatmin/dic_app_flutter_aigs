Colour-change and asteriated (star) garnets have been reported. Occurs worldwide, depending on the variety. Red garnets (almandine-pyrope) have been used since antiquity from various sources, especially in India, Sri Lanka, Bohemia and Portugal between 300 BCE and the 7th century CE. It has been used in the manufacture of composite stones (e.g. garnet-topped doublets) and as an abrasive.

It has a special movable stone holder (stone tongs) to secure and rotate cut gem materials and is usually fitted with a substage with dark-field and bright-field illumination, an overhead lamp and one or more fibre optic guides. Many models have a diaphragm to control transmitted light from the lamp located in the substage, while some may have polarizing filters to additionally work as a polariscope and dichroscope, and to enable observations in polarizing light (e.g. enhancing inclusion visibility). An immersion cell is generally provided. It may also be used to inspect the absorption spectrum of a sample by replacing one eyepiece with a hand-held spectroscope. A third ocular may be present to attach a photo or video camera. The gemmological microscope is a key instrument for the gemmologist as it enables the observation of inclusions, surface features (e.g. polish features, abrasion, fracture), surface lustre, growth sectors or zones, colour distribution and zoning, among other features to assist in identification, synthetic detection, treatment detection or considerations on origin.

Gemmology was organized as a discipline in the early 1900s in London to help the local jewellery trade to distinguish natural rubies from the synthetic rubies that had been introduced at the time. What is sometimes called “classic gemmology” still manages to respond to most gem-testing challenges using simple instrumentation (e.g. loupe, microscope, refractometer, polariscope, spectroscope, dichroscope, longwave and short wave UV, colour filters). It has many practical uses, namely in gemstone mining, lapidary, gem trade, jewellery design, valuations and appraisals, trading standards, laboratory testing and reporting, customs and excise, legal litigation, museum and collection curation and collecting. The word seems to have been used for the first time in 1811 in John Pinkerton’s book Petrology.</p>",

Typical identifying characteristics include gas bubbles, swirl marks, conchoidal fracture, rounded facet edges and low thermal inertia. Devitrification may be instigated to produce translucent material, sometimes with dendrite-like inclusions. A higher content of lead or other metals (e.g. titanium or zirconium oxides) increases refractive index, reflectivity, dispersion and specific gravity but lowers hardness. Such material is known in the trade as “crystal”, lead glass or flint glass, and was introduced in the 17th century.

A pioneer in the study of inclusions in gemstones that created the groundwork for origin determination, he published 13 books, including the 1953 Inclusions as a Means of Gemstone Identification and the famous 1986 Photoatlas of Inclusions in Gemstones, co-authored with John I. Koivula (volume II and volume III published in 2005 and 2006, respectively). Further publications include the popular World Map of Gem Deposits (1988) and more that 250 scientific papers.
